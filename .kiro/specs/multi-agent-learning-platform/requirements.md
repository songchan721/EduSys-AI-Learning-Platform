## Introduction

The EduSys AI Learning Platform is a next-generation, AI-powered learning platform that delivers personalized and autonomous educational experiences. The system leverages a scalable Microservice Architecture (MSA) on Kubernetes with Redpanda as the event streaming platform to provide users with dynamically generated learning paths, intelligent scheduling, and comprehensive management tools for administrators.

**Frontend Architecture:** The platform uses React 18+ with TypeScript, Redux Toolkit for state management, and Material-UI for the component library. Real-time communication is handled through WebSocket connections with fallback to Server-Sent Events.

**Backend Architecture:** The platform is built using Java 21, Spring Boot 3.3.x, and Gradle KTS for build management, with Redpanda providing the event-driven communication backbone. Services include API Gateway, User Service, Agent Orchestrator, Content Service, Payment Service, Notification Service, and Analytics Service.

**Database Architecture:** Each microservice has its own PostgreSQL database following the database-per-service pattern, with Redis for caching and session management, and S3-compatible storage for files and generated content.

**Message Queue Architecture:** Redpanda (Kafka-compatible) handles all asynchronous communication between services with structured event schemas and guaranteed delivery patterns.

The system transforms static educational content into a dynamic, responsive, and adaptive learning journey through multi-agent AI research, automated content generation, and intelligent scheduling.

### Requirement 67: AI Agent State Management and Coordination Specification
**User Story:** As an AI agent developer, I want detailed specifications for agent state management and coordination, so that agents can work together reliably with proper resource management and failure recovery.

#### Acceptance Criteria
**Agent State Persistence and Recovery:**
1.  WHEN agents execute THEN their state SHALL be persisted in Redis with keys: `agent:{session_id}:{agent_type}:state` containing execution context, progress, and intermediate results
2.  WHEN agent checkpoints are created THEN they SHALL be stored every 30 seconds with incremental state updates and rollback capabilities
3.  WHEN agent failures occur THEN the system SHALL support resuming from the last checkpoint with state validation and consistency checks
4.  WHEN agent timeouts happen THEN the system SHALL gracefully terminate agents, preserve partial results, and trigger failure recovery workflows
5.  WHEN agent resources are managed THEN each agent SHALL have dedicated resource pools with CPU (2-8 cores), memory (4-16GB), and storage (10-100GB) limits
6.  WHEN agent scaling is needed THEN the system SHALL support horizontal scaling with load balancing and session affinity based on user_id

**Agent Communication and Coordination:**
7.  WHEN agents communicate THEN they SHALL use structured message passing through Redis pub/sub with message schemas: `{"from": "agent_type", "to": "agent_type", "session_id": "uuid", "message_type": "data_transfer", "payload": {}}`
8.  WHEN agent handoffs occur THEN the previous agent SHALL publish completion events with output validation and the next agent SHALL acknowledge receipt before starting
9.  WHEN agent conflicts arise THEN the Agent Orchestrator SHALL implement conflict resolution with priority-based scheduling and resource arbitration
10. WHEN agent monitoring is performed THEN the system SHALL track execution metrics: start_time, end_time, cpu_usage, memory_usage, api_calls, tokens_used, quality_score
11. WHEN agent dependencies are managed THEN the system SHALL validate prerequisite completion, data availability, and resource readiness before agent startup
12. WHEN agent cleanup is performed THEN the system SHALL implement graceful shutdown with state preservation, resource deallocation, and cleanup verification

### Requirement 68: Real-Time Frontend-Backend Synchronization Specification
**User Story:** As a user, I want seamless real-time synchronization between frontend and backend, so that I see live updates without delays or inconsistencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria
**WebSocket Connection Management:**
1.  WHEN WebSocket connections are established THEN they SHALL authenticate using JWT tokens with automatic token refresh 5 minutes before expiration
2.  WHEN connection failures occur THEN the frontend SHALL implement exponential backoff reconnection (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s, max 30s) with connection state indicators
3.  WHEN multiple browser tabs are open THEN each tab SHALL maintain independent WebSocket connections with shared state synchronization via BroadcastChannel API
4.  WHEN network conditions change THEN the system SHALL adapt message frequency and implement message queuing during poor connectivity
5.  WHEN user sessions expire THEN WebSocket connections SHALL be gracefully closed with proper cleanup and re-authentication prompts
6.  WHEN system maintenance occurs THEN the backend SHALL send maintenance notifications 5 minutes before disconnecting clients

**Real-Time Data Synchronization:**
7.  WHEN backend state changes THEN the system SHALL broadcast updates to relevant clients based on user permissions and subscription filters
8.  WHEN frontend state changes THEN the system SHALL implement optimistic updates with server confirmation within 500ms and rollback on conflicts
9.  WHEN concurrent edits occur THEN the system SHALL implement operational transformation with conflict resolution and merge strategies
10. WHEN offline scenarios happen THEN the frontend SHALL queue operations locally and sync when connectivity is restored with conflict detection
11. WHEN real-time notifications are sent THEN they SHALL be delivered with priority levels (critical, high, normal, low) and appropriate UI treatments
12. WHEN synchronization errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with recovery actions and manual sync options

### Requirement 69: Cross-Service Error Handling and Circuit Breaker Specification
**User Story:** As a system reliability engineer, I want comprehensive error handling and circuit breaker patterns, so that service failures don't cascade and the system remains resilient.

#### Acceptance Criteria
**Circuit Breaker Implementation:**
1.  WHEN service calls are made THEN each service SHALL implement circuit breakers with thresholds: 50% error rate over 10 requests triggers OPEN state
2.  WHEN circuit breakers are OPEN THEN services SHALL return cached responses or degraded functionality for 30 seconds before attempting HALF-OPEN state
3.  WHEN circuit breakers are HALF-OPEN THEN services SHALL allow 3 test requests and return to CLOSED on success or OPEN on failure
4.  WHEN downstream services are unavailable THEN calling services SHALL implement fallback strategies: cached data, default responses, or graceful degradation
5.  WHEN error rates exceed thresholds THEN the system SHALL trigger alerts and automatic scaling or failover procedures
6.  WHEN circuit breaker states change THEN the system SHALL log state transitions and notify monitoring systems

**Error Propagation and Recovery:**
7.  WHEN errors occur in microservices THEN they SHALL be categorized as: TRANSIENT (retry), PERMANENT (fail-fast), TIMEOUT (circuit-break), VALIDATION (user-error)
8.  WHEN error propagation happens THEN services SHALL include correlation IDs and error context in all error responses and logs
9.  WHEN retry logic is implemented THEN services SHALL use exponential backoff with jitter and maximum retry limits (3 attempts for transient errors)
10. WHEN error recovery is needed THEN services SHALL implement compensating transactions and rollback procedures for distributed operations
11. WHEN error monitoring is performed THEN the system SHALL track error rates, error types, and recovery times with automated alerting
12. WHEN error reporting is generated THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error analytics with root cause analysis and resolution recommendations
